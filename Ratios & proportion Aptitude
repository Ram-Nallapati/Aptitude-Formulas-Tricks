# 🔥 Ratios & Proportions - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🔥

Ratios & Proportions problems are crucial in aptitude tests for **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and other top companies. Below are the **formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve these problems efficiently.

---

## **🔹 1. Definition of Ratio**
A **ratio** is a comparison of two quantities in the same unit:
```math
A : B = \frac{A}{B}
```
Example: The ratio of 10 and 5 is **10:5 or 2:1**

---

## **🔹 2. Definition of Proportion**
A proportion states that two ratios are equal:
```math
A : B = C : D \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{A}{B} = \frac{C}{D}
```
Example: **4:6 = 10:15** because **4/6 = 10/15**

---

## **🔹 3. Cross Multiplication Rule**
If:
```math
\frac{A}{B} = \frac{C}{D}
```
Then:
```math
A \times D = B \times C
```
Example: **4:6 = 10:15**, then:
```math
4 \times 15 = 6 \times 10
```

## **📌 Tricks & Shortcuts for Quick Calculations**

### **🔹 1. Finding the Fourth Proportional**
If:
```math
A : B = C : D
```
Then, the fourth proportional **D** is:
```math
D = \frac{B \times C}{A}
```
Example: **Find D in 3:9 = 6:D**
```math
D = \frac{9 \times 6}{3} = 18
```

---

### **🔹 2. Finding the Mean Proportional**
If **A, B, and C** are in proportion:
```math
A : B = B : C
```
Then, the mean proportional **B** is:
```math
B = \sqrt{A \times C}
```
Example: Find **B** if **4:B = B:16**
```math
B = \sqrt{4 \times 16} = 8
```

---

### **🔹 3. If the Ratio is Increased or Decreased by a Percentage**
If **A : B** increases by **X%**, the new ratio is:
```math
(A + X\%A) : (B + X\%B)
```
Example: If **3:5** increases by **20%**, then:
```math
(3 + 20\% \times 3) : (5 + 20\% \times 5)
```
```math
(3.6 : 6)
```

---

### **🔹 4. If the Sum of Terms is Given**
If the sum of two numbers in ratio **A:B** is **S**, then:
```math
A = \frac{A}{A + B} \times S, \quad B = \frac{B}{A + B} \times S
```
Example: **Find numbers if 3:7 and sum is 100**
```math
A = \frac{3}{3+7} \times 100 = 30, \quad B = \frac{7}{10} \times 100 = 70
```

---

### **🔹 5. Finding New Ratio When Quantities are Added**
If **A:B** changes when **X, Y** are added:
```math
\text{New Ratio} = (A + X) : (B + Y)
```
Example: If **4:5** becomes **5:6** after adding **1** to both:
```math
(4+1) : (5+1) = 5:6
```

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: The ratio of ages of A & B is 3:5. If sum is 40, find ages.**
**Solution:**
```math
A = \frac{3}{3+5} \times 40 = 15, \quad B = \frac{5}{8} \times 40 = 25
```

---

### **📝 Q2: Find the fourth proportional of 4, 8, and 12.**
**Solution:**
```math
D = \frac{8 \times 12}{4} = 24
```

---

### **📝 Q3: The salaries of A & B are in ratio 2:3. If A's salary is increased by 20% and B’s by 10%, find new ratio.**
**Solution:**
```math
A_{new} = 2 + 20\% \times 2 = 2.4, \quad B_{new} = 3 + 10\% \times 3 = 3.3
```
```math
\text{New Ratio} = 2.4:3.3 = 24:33 = 8:11
```
