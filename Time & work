# ⏳ Time & Work - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions ⏳

Time and Work problems are essential in **aptitude tests** for **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and other top companies. Below are the **key formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve Time & Work problems **quickly and efficiently**. 🚀  

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Formula**
```math
Work Done = Time \times Efficiency
```
Where:  
- **Work Done** = Total work completed  
- **Time** = Number of days/hours taken  
- **Efficiency** = Work done per unit time  

Another way to express this is:
```math
Work = Rate \times Time
```
---

## **🔹 2. Work Done in a Given Time**
If a person can complete a task in **N days**, then:
```math
Work done in 1 day = \frac{1}{N}
```
- If **A** can do a job in **X days**, then **A’s 1-day work** = `1/X`
- If **B** can do the same job in **Y days**, then **B’s 1-day work** = `1/Y`
- If **A & B** work together, their **1-day work** = `1/X + 1/Y`

---

## **🔹 3. Finding Total Work**
If A does **W%** of work in **D days**, then:
```math
Total Work = \frac{D \times 100}{W}
```
---

## **🔹 4. Time Taken to Complete Work**
If A’s efficiency is **E** and total work is **W**, then:
```math
Time = \frac{W}{E}
```
---

## **🔹 5. Work Ratio Formula**
If **A** and **B** work in the ratio `m:n`, then:
```math
Time Ratio = \frac{1}{m} : \frac{1}{n} = n : m
```
Thus, **more efficiency → less time required**.

---

## **🔹 6. Efficiency-Based Formula**
If efficiency increases/decreases by **X%**, then:
```math
New Time = \frac{Old Time \times 100}{100 \pm X}
```
(Use **`+X`** for increase, **`-X`** for decrease)

---

## **🔹 7. Alternative Work Formula**
If A does a work in **X days** and B is **k times efficient** than A, then B alone will take:
```math
Time = \frac{X}{k}
```

## **📌 Tricks & Shortcuts for Quick Calculations**

### **🔹 1. When More People Join or Leave**
- If a person **joins later**, subtract their part-time contribution.
- If a person **leaves early**, subtract their unfinished work.

---

### **🔹 2. If Work Involves Pipes & Cisterns**
For a filling pipe:
```math
Net Work = \text{Filling Rate} - \text{Leak Rate}
```
For an emptying pipe:
```math
Net Work = \text{Filling Rate} + \text{Emptying Rate}
```

---

### **🔹 3. If Work is Done in Fractions**
- If `A` completes `1/X` of work in **1 day**, total work is `X days`.
- If `A & B` together finish `1/Y` of work in **1 day**, total work is `Y days`.

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A can do a job in 10 days, B can do it in 15 days. How many days will they take together?**
**Solution:**
```math
1 \text{-day work of A} = \frac{1}{10}
```
```math
1 \text{-day work of B} = \frac{1}{15}
```
Total work per day:
```math
\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{3}{30} + \frac{2}{30} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}
```
Thus, total time taken:
```math
6 \text{ days}
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A is 3 times as efficient as B. If B alone can complete the work in 36 days, how long will A & B together take?**
**Solution:**
```math
\text{A’s Time} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \text{ days}
```
```math
1 \text{-day work of A} = \frac{1}{12}, \quad 1 \text{-day work of B} = \frac{1}{36}
```
Total 1-day work:
```math
\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}
```
Total time taken:
```math
9 \text{ days}
```

## **🚀 Rapid-Fire Tricks for Quick Answers**
| Trick | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| **Work = Efficiency × Time** | `W = E × T` |
| **Total Work = LCM of Individual Work** | `W = LCM(X, Y, Z, …)` |
| **A is k times efficient than B** | `B's time = k × A's time` |
| **Efficiency % Change** | `New Time = Old Time × (100 / (100 ± Change%))` |
| **Alternate Days Work** | `Total Work = (A’s 1-day work + B’s 1-day work) × Days` |
