# 🤝 Partnerships - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🤝

Partnership problems are frequently asked in aptitude tests for companies like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and other competitive exams. Below are key **formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve partnership questions quickly.  

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Partnership Formula**  
In a business partnership, the **profit/loss is divided in the ratio of their investments**.

```math
	ext{Profit Share} = \left( rac{	ext{Investment of a Partner} 	imes 	ext{Time}}{	ext{Total Investment}} 
ight) 	imes 	ext{Total Profit}
```

### **🔹 Types of Partnerships:**
1. **Simple Partnership** - When partners invest money **for the same time**.
2. **Compound Partnership** - When partners invest money **for different time periods**.

---

## **🔹 2. Ratio of Profits in Simple Partnership**
If **A & B** invest **P₁ & P₂** for the **same time (T)**, then:
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = P₁ : P₂
```

**Example:** If A invests ₹5000, and B invests ₹10000, then profit is divided as:
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = 5000:10000 = 1:2
```

---

## **🔹 3. Ratio of Profits in Compound Partnership**
If **A & B** invest for different times **T₁ & T₂**, then:
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = (P₁ 	imes T₁) : (P₂ 	imes T₂)
```

**Example:** A invests ₹5000 for 2 years, and B invests ₹10000 for 1 year.
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = (5000 	imes 2) : (10000 	imes 1) = 10000 : 10000 = 1:1
```

---

## **🔹 4. Finding a Partner's Share in Profit**
If total profit = ₹P, and A's investment ratio is **x**, then:
```math
A's 	ext{Share} = \left( rac{x}{	ext{Total Ratio}} 
ight) 	imes P
```

---

## **🔹 5. Partner Joining Late or Leaving Early**
If a partner joins after **T months**, the effective time for them is **(Total Time - T)**.

**Example:** If A invests for **12 months**, and B joins after **4 months**, then:
- A’s effective time = 12 months
- B’s effective time = 12 - 4 = 8 months

Profit Ratio:
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = (P_A 	imes 12) : (P_B 	imes 8)
```

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A & B invest ₹3000 and ₹6000 in a business. If the total profit is ₹4500, find A's share.**
**Solution:**
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = 3000 : 6000 = 1:2
```
A’s Share:
```math
\left( rac{1}{3} 
ight) 	imes 4500 = ₹1500
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A invests ₹5000 for 2 years, and B invests ₹3000 for 3 years. Find their profit ratio.**
**Solution:**
```math
	ext{Profit Ratio} = (5000 	imes 2) : (3000 	imes 3) = 10000 : 9000 = 10:9
```

---

### **📝 Q3: A starts a business with ₹6000. After 4 months, B joins with ₹8000. At the end of the year, find the profit ratio.**
**Solution:**
- A’s effective time = 12 months
- B’s effective time = 12 - 4 = 8 months

Profit Ratio:
```math
(6000 	imes 12) : (8000 	imes 8) = 72000 : 64000 = 9:8
```
