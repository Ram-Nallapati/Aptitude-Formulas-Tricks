# 🔥 Simple Interest - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🔥

Simple Interest (SI) problems are commonly asked in aptitude tests for companies like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and others. Below are key **formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve SI questions quickly.  

---

## **🔹 1. Simple Interest Formula**  
```math
SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
```
Where:  
- **SI** = Simple Interest  
- **P** = Principal Amount  
- **R** = Rate of Interest per annum  
- **T** = Time (in years)  

---

## **🔹 2. Total Amount (A)**
```math
A = P + SI
```
```math
A = P \left( 1 + \frac{R \times T}{100} \right)
```

---

## **🔹 3. Finding Principal (P)**
```math
P = \frac{SI \times 100}{R \times T}
```

---

## **🔹 4. Finding Rate of Interest (R)**
```math
R = \frac{SI \times 100}{P \times T}
```

---

## **🔹 5. Finding Time (T)**
```math
T = \frac{SI \times 100}{P \times R}
```

---

## **📌 Tricks & Shortcuts for Quick Calculations**

### **🔹 1. When Time is Given in Months or Days**  
- If **T is in months**, use:
```math
T = \frac{\text{Number of months}}{12}
```
- If **T is in days**, use:
```math
T = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{365}
```
(Take **360 days** in some bank-related problems)

---

### **🔹 2. If SI for Different Time Periods is Given**
- If **SI for 1 year = X**, then for **T years = X × T**
- If **SI for 2 years = Y**, then for **1 year = Y/2**  

---

### **🔹 3. If Principal is Doubled / Tripled**
```math
SI \propto P, R, T
```
- If **P doubles**, SI **also doubles**.
- If **T doubles**, SI **also doubles**.
- If **R doubles**, SI **also doubles**.

---

### **🔹 4. Finding Rate When SI is a Fraction of Principal**
If SI is **x% of P**, then:
```math
R \times T = x
```
From this,  
```math
R = \frac{x}{T} \quad \text{or} \quad T = \frac{x}{R}
```

**Example:** If SI is **20% of P** in **5 years**, then  
```math
R = \frac{20}{5} = 4\% \text{ per annum}
```

---

### **🔹 5. If SI for Different People is Given**
If two people invest different amounts at the same **R and T**, then:
```math
\frac{SI_1}{SI_2} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
```

---

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: Find SI when P = ₹2000, R = 5% per annum, T = 3 years**
**Solution:**  
```math
SI = \frac{2000 \times 5 \times 3}{100} = ₹300
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A sum becomes ₹6600 in 5 years at 8% per annum. Find the Principal (P).**
**Solution:**  
```math
SI = A - P
```
Using:
```math
P = \frac{A}{1 + \frac{R \times T}{100}}
```
```math
P = \frac{6600}{1 + \frac{8 \times 5}{100}} = \frac{6600}{1.4} = ₹4714.28
```

---

### **📝 Q3: At what rate will ₹5000 become ₹7000 in 4 years?**
**Solution:**  
```math
SI = A - P = 7000 - 5000 = ₹2000
```
Using:
```math
R = \frac{SI \times 100}{P \times T} = \frac{2000 \times 100}{5000 \times 4} = 10\% \text{ per annum}
```

---

### **📝 Q4: A sum becomes 5 times in 10 years. Find the Rate of Interest.**
**Solution:**  
```math
A = 5P
```
```math
SI = A - P = 5P - P = 4P
```
Using:
```math
R = \frac{SI \times 100}{P \times T} = \frac{4P \times 100}{P \times 10} = 40\%
```

## **🚀 Rapid-Fire Tricks for Quick Answers**
| Trick | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| **SI is % of P** | \( R \times T = \text{SI% of P} \) |
| **A becomes n times in T years** | \( R = \frac{(n-1) \times 100}{T} \) |
| **P becomes double in T years** | \( R = \frac{100}{T} \) |
| **P becomes triple in T years** | \( R = \frac{200}{T} \) |
