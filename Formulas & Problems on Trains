# 🚆 Problems on Trains - Tricks & Formulas for Aptitude Tests 🚆

Problems on Trains are common in competitive exams and aptitude tests for **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and other top companies. Here are the **key formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve them quickly.

---

## **📌 1. Basic Formulas**

### **🔹 Speed Formula**
```math
	speed = \frac{distance}{time}
```
Where:
- **Speed** is in km/hr or m/s
- **Distance** is in meters or kilometers
- **Time** is in seconds or hours

### **🔹 Conversion of Speed**
```math
1 \text{ km/hr} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ m/s}
```
```math
1 \text{ m/s} = \frac{18}{5} \text{ km/hr}
```

## **📌 2. Train Passing a Stationary Object**

If a train of **length L** meters is passing a stationary object (pole, tree, standing man), then:
```math
Time = \frac{L}{S}
```
Where:
- **L** = Length of train (meters)
- **S** = Speed of train (m/s)

---

## **📌 3. Train Passing a Platform / Tunnel / Bridge**

If a train of **length L** meters crosses a platform/tunnel/bridge of **length P** meters,
```math
Time = \frac{L + P}{S}
```
Where:
- **L** = Length of train (meters)
- **P** = Length of platform/tunnel/bridge (meters)
- **S** = Speed of train (m/s)

---

## **📌 4. Two Trains Moving in the Same Direction**

If two trains of speeds **S₁** and **S₂** are moving in the same direction,
```math
Relative \ Speed = S_1 - S_2
```
```math
Time = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2}
```
Where:
- **L₁, L₂** = Lengths of the two trains (meters)
- **S₁, S₂** = Speeds of the two trains (m/s), where **S₁ > S₂**

---

## **📌 5. Two Trains Moving in Opposite Directions**

If two trains are moving in opposite directions,
```math
Relative \ Speed = S_1 + S_2
```
```math
Time = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2}
```
Where:
- **L₁, L₂** = Lengths of the two trains (meters)
- **S₁, S₂** = Speeds of the two trains (m/s)

---

## **📌 6. Finding Speed When Time Difference is Given**

If two trains cross a point **T₁** and **T₂** seconds apart, and their lengths are **L₁** and **L₂**, then:
```math
Speed = \frac{L_1 - L_2}{T_1 - T_2}
```

---

## **📌 7. Train Overtaking a Moving Object (Bike, Cyclist, Car)**

If a train of **length L** meters overtakes a moving object (bike, car, etc.) with speed **S₂**, then:
```math
Time = \frac{L}{S_1 - S_2}
```
Where:
- **S₁** = Speed of train (m/s)
- **S₂** = Speed of object (m/s)

---

## **📌 8. Train Crossing a Man Moving in the Opposite Direction**

If a train of **length L** meters crosses a man moving in the opposite direction with speed **S₂**, then:
```math
Time = \frac{L}{S_1 + S_2}
```
Where:
- **S₁** = Speed of train (m/s)
- **S₂** = Speed of man (m/s)

## **🚀 Rapid-Fire Tricks for Quick Answers**

| Scenario | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Train crossing a pole | \( Time = \frac{L}{S} \) |
| Train crossing a platform | \( Time = \frac{L + P}{S} \) |
| Trains in the same direction | \( Time = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2} \) |
| Trains in opposite directions | \( Time = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2} \) |
| Train overtaking a moving object | \( Time = \frac{L}{S_1 - S_2} \) |
| Train crossing a moving person (opposite) | \( Time = \frac{L}{S_1 + S_2} \) |

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A train of length 200m crosses a pole in 10s. Find its speed.**
**Solution:**
```math
Speed = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ m/s}
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A 150m train crosses a platform of 250m in 20s. Find its speed.**
**Solution:**
```math
Speed = \frac{150 + 250}{20} = \frac{400}{20} = 20 \text{ m/s}
```

---

### **📝 Q3: Two trains 120m and 150m long move in the same direction at speeds 30 m/s and 20 m/s. Find the time taken to cross each other.**
**Solution:**
```math
Relative \ Speed = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ m/s}
```
```math
Time = \frac{120 + 150}{10} = \frac{270}{10} = 27 \text{ s}
```

---

### **📝 Q4: A 180m train crosses a man running at 10 m/s in the opposite direction in 9s. Find train speed.**
**Solution:**
```math
S + 10 = \frac{180}{9}
```
```math
S + 10 = 20
```
```math
S = 10 \text{ m/s}
```
