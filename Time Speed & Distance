# ⏳ Time, Speed & Distance - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🚀

Time, Speed, and Distance (TSD) problems are frequently asked in aptitude tests for **Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other top companies**. This document provides **key formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve TSD problems efficiently.  

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Formula**
```math

distance = speed \times time
```
Where:
- **Distance (D)** is measured in km, meters, or miles.
- **Speed (S)** is measured in km/hr, m/s, or mph.
- **Time (T)** is measured in hours, minutes, or seconds.

---

## **🔹 2. Conversions**
- **Speed Conversion:**
  - \( 1 \) km/hr = \( \frac{5}{18} \) m/sec
  - \( 1 \) m/sec = \( \frac{18}{5} \) km/hr
- **Time Conversion:**
  - \( 1 \) hour = \( 60 \) minutes = \( 3600 \) seconds

---

## **🔹 3. Average Speed Formula**
### **🔸 Case 1: When Equal Distances are Covered at Different Speeds**
```math

total\ average\ speed = \frac{2xy}{x+y}
```
Where:
- **x** = Speed for first half
- **y** = Speed for second half

### **🔸 Case 2: When Different Distances are Covered at Different Speeds**
```math

total\ average\ speed = \frac{total\ distance}{total\ time}
```

---

## **🔹 4. Relative Speed**
- **If two objects move in opposite directions:**
  ```math
  relative\ speed = speed_1 + speed_2
  ```
- **If two objects move in the same direction:**
  ```math
  relative\ speed = |speed_1 - speed_2|
  ```

---

## **🔹 5. Train Problems**
### **🔸 Train Passing a Pole / Point**
```math

time = \frac{length\ of\ train}{speed\ of\ train}
```

### **🔸 Train Passing a Platform / Bridge**
```math

time = \frac{length\ of\ train + length\ of\ platform}{speed\ of\ train}
```

### **🔸 Two Trains Moving Towards Each Other**
```math

time = \frac{distance}{relative\ speed}
```

---

## **🔹 6. Boats & Streams**
- **Speed of boat in still water =** \( \frac{upstream\ speed + downstream\ speed}{2} \)
- **Speed of stream =** \( \frac{downstream\ speed - upstream\ speed}{2} \)
- **Effective Speed:**
  - **Downstream:** \( speed_{boat} + speed_{stream} \)
  - **Upstream:** \( speed_{boat} - speed_{stream} \)

---

## **🔹 7. Circular Tracks**
### **🔸 Case 1: If two runners move in the same direction**
```math

time = \frac{circumference}{|speed_1 - speed_2|}
```

### **🔸 Case 2: If two runners move in opposite directions**
```math

time = \frac{circumference}{speed_1 + speed_2}
```

---

## **🔹 8. Shortcuts & Tricks**
### **🔸 1. If Speed Increases, Time Decreases (Inverse Relation)**
- If speed is **doubled**, time is **halved**.
- If speed is **tripled**, time becomes **one-third**.

### **🔸 2. Ratio-Based Shortcut**
If speed is in the ratio **x:y**, then time taken will be in the ratio **y:x**.

### **🔸 3. Meeting Point Formula**
When two objects move towards each other from two points A and B:
```math

time = \frac{distance}{speed_1 + speed_2}
```

## **📌 Example Problems & Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A car travels 60 km at 30 km/hr and another 60 km at 40 km/hr. Find the average speed.**
**Solution:**
Using equal distance formula:
```math
average\ speed = \frac{2xy}{x+y} = \frac{2 \times 30 \times 40}{30+40} = \frac{2400}{70} = 34.28 km/hr
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A train 120m long passes a pole in 6 sec. Find its speed.**
**Solution:**
```math
speed = \frac{distance}{time} = \frac{120}{6} = 20 m/s
```
Converting to km/hr:
```math
speed = 20 \times \frac{18}{5} = 72 km/hr
```

---

### **📝 Q3: A boat goes 30 km downstream in 3 hours and returns in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat and stream.**
**Solution:**
```math
speed_{downstream} = \frac{30}{3} = 10 km/hr
```
```math
speed_{upstream} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 km/hr
```
Speed of boat in still water:
```math
speed_{boat} = \frac{10 + 6}{2} = 8 km/hr
```
Speed of stream:
```math
speed_{stream} = \frac{10 - 6}{2} = 2 km/hr
```
