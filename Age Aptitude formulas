# 🔥 Aptitude Tricks & Formulas - Problems on Ages 🔥

Problems on ages are commonly asked in competitive exams and aptitude tests. Below are **formulas, shortcuts, and 
tricks** to solve age-related questions quickly. 🚀

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Age Formula**

If the **present age** is **X**, then:
- **Age after n years** = X + n
- **Age before n years** = X - n
- **n years ago, age was** = X - n
- **n years later, age will be** = X + n

---

## **🔹 2. Average Age Formula**

If the average age of a group of **N** people is **A**, then:
```math
Total age = A \times N
```
If a new person with age **B** joins, the new average is:
```math
\text{New Average} = \frac{(A \times N) + B}{N+1}
```
If a person with age **B** leaves, the new average is:
```math
\text{New Average} = \frac{(A \times N) - B}{N-1}
```

---

## **🔹 3. Ratio of Ages**

If the present age of **A** and **B** is in the ratio **x : y**, then:
- After **n** years, the new ratio = **(x + n) : (y + n)**
- Before **n** years, the ratio = **(x - n) : (y - n)**

---

## **🔹 4. Age Difference Rule**

The difference between the ages of two people **always remains constant** over the years.
```math
\text{Age Difference} = \text{(Present Age of Older)} - \text{(Present Age of Younger)}
```

---

## **🔹 5. Finding Present Age from Past/Future Statements**

If the age of a person is given as **X years ago** and their age **Y years later** is known, then:
```math
\text{Present Age} = \frac{(X + Y)}{2}
```

## **📌 Tricks & Shortcuts for Quick Calculations**

### **🔹 1. If Father’s Age is Given in Terms of Son’s Age**
If a father’s age is **x times** his son’s age and after **n years**, their ages will be in ratio **a : b**, then:
```math
\frac{X + n}{Y + n} = \frac{a}{b}
```
Solve for **X** and **Y**.

---

### **🔹 2. If Sum of Present Ages is Given**
If the sum of present ages of two people is **S**, and their age difference is **D**, then:
```math
\text{Older Person’s Age} = \frac{S + D}{2}
```
```math
\text{Younger Person’s Age} = \frac{S - D}{2}
```

---

### **🔹 3. If Future Age Ratio is Given**
If the ratio of two people’s **ages after n years** is **a : b**, then:
```math
\frac{X + n}{Y + n} = \frac{a}{b}
```
Solve for **X** and **Y**.

---

### **🔹 4. Reverse Calculation from Future Age**
If a person’s age **n years ago** was **X** years, then their present age is:
```math
\text{Present Age} = X + n
```

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years, the father’s age will be twice that of his son. Find their present ages.**
**Solution:**

Let the son’s present age be **X** years. Then the father’s age is **3X**.

After 12 years,
```math
3X + 12 = 2(X + 12)
```
```math
3X + 12 = 2X + 24
```
```math
3X - 2X = 24 - 12
```
```math
X = 12
```
So, the **son is 12 years old**, and the **father is 36 years old**.

---

### **📝 Q2: The present age of A and B are in the ratio 5:7. After 6 years, their age ratio becomes 3:4. Find their present ages.**
**Solution:**

Let A’s and B’s present ages be **5X** and **7X**, respectively.

After 6 years,
```math
\frac{5X + 6}{7X + 6} = \frac{3}{4}
```
Cross multiplying,
```math
4(5X + 6) = 3(7X + 6)
```
```math
20X + 24 = 21X + 18
```
```math
21X - 20X = 24 - 18
```
```math
X = 6
```
So, **A’s present age = 5 × 6 = 30 years** and **B’s present age = 7 × 6 = 42 years**.

---

### **📝 Q3: The sum of the ages of a father and son is 50 years. Four years ago, the father was three times as old as the son. Find their present ages.**
**Solution:**

Let the son’s present age be **X** and the father’s present age be **50 - X**.

Four years ago,
```math
(50 - X - 4) = 3(X - 4)
```
```math
46 - X = 3X - 12
```
```math
46 + 12 = 3X + X
```
```math
4X = 58
```
```math
X = 14.5
```
So, the **son is 14.5 years old**, and the **father is 35.5 years old**.

## **🚀 Rapid-Fire Tricks for Quick Answers**

| Trick | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| **Sum of present ages given** | Older age = \((S + D)/2\), Younger age = \((S - D)/2\) |
| **Age before or after n years** | Present Age = (Past/Future Age) ± n |
| **Father-Son Age Ratio** | \((X + n)/(Y + n) = a/b\) |
| **If A is x years older than B** | A = B + x |
