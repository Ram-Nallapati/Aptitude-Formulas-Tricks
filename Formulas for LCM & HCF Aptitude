# 🔥 LCM & HCF - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🔥

LCM (Least Common Multiple) and HCF (Highest Common Factor) are essential topics in aptitude tests for companies like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft**, and others. Below are the **formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve these questions quickly.  

---

## **🔹 1. Least Common Multiple (LCM)**
**Definition:** The smallest number that is **exactly divisible** by all given numbers.

### **🔹 LCM Formula for Two Numbers**
```math
LCM(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{HCF(a, b)}
```

### **🔹 LCM of Multiple Numbers**
Find the **LCM pairwise**, using:
```math
LCM(a, b, c) = LCM(LCM(a, b), c)
```

---

## **🔹 2. Highest Common Factor (HCF) or GCD**
**Definition:** The largest number that **divides** all given numbers exactly.

### **🔹 HCF Formula for Two Numbers**
```math
HCF(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{LCM(a, b)}
```

### **🔹 HCF of Multiple Numbers**
Find the **HCF pairwise**, using:
```math
HCF(a, b, c) = HCF(HCF(a, b), c)
```

## **📌 Tricks & Shortcuts for Quick Calculations**

### **🔹 1. Prime Factorization Method**
1. Write the **prime factors** of each number.
2. **LCM** → Take the highest power of all primes.
3. **HCF** → Take the lowest power of all primes.

### **🔹 2. Division Method (for Large Numbers)**
1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
2. Replace the larger number with the remainder.
3. Repeat until remainder = **0**.
4. The last divisor is the **HCF**.

### **🔹 3. Shortcut for Two Numbers**
- **If LCM & HCF are given:**
```math
LCM \times HCF = a \times b
```
- **If numbers are co-prime:**
```math
LCM = a \times b, \quad HCF = 1
```

## **📌 Important Properties**

### **🔹 1. Relationship Between LCM & HCF**
For **two numbers**:
```math
HCF \times LCM = Product \text{ of Numbers}
```
For **three numbers**:
```math
HCF \times LCM \neq \text{Product of Numbers}
```

### **🔹 2. LCM & HCF of Fractions**
```math
LCM = \frac{LCM \text{ of numerators}}{HCF \text{ of denominators}}
```
```math
HCF = \frac{HCF \text{ of numerators}}{LCM \text{ of denominators}}
```

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: Find the LCM and HCF of 24 and 36.**
**Solution:**  
Prime Factorization:
```math
24 = 2^3 \times 3^1, \quad 36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
```
- **LCM** = Highest powers → \(2^3 \times 3^2 = 72\)
- **HCF** = Lowest powers → \(2^2 \times 3^1 = 12\)

---

### **📝 Q2: If HCF(18, 48) = 6, find LCM.**
**Solution:**  
Using:
```math
HCF \times LCM = 18 \times 48
```
```math
LCM = \frac{18 \times 48}{6} = 144
```

---

### **📝 Q3: Find the LCM and HCF of 3/5, 9/10, and 12/15.**
**Solution:**
- **LCM of Numerators**: LCM(3, 9, 12) = 36
- **HCF of Denominators**: HCF(5, 10, 15) = 5
- **LCM of Fractions**:
```math
LCM = \frac{36}{5}
```
- **HCF of Numerators**: HCF(3, 9, 12) = 3
- **LCM of Denominators**: LCM(5, 10, 15) = 30
- **HCF of Fractions**:
```math
HCF = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10}
```
