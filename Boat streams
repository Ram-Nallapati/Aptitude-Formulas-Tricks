# 🚤 Boats & Streams - Formulas & Tricks for Aptitude Questions 🚤

Problems on **Boats & Streams** are common in competitive exams like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft** hiring tests. Below are the **key formulas, shortcuts, and tricks** to solve these problems efficiently.  

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Terminologies**
- **Still Water Speed (B):** Speed of the boat in calm water.
- **Stream Speed (S):** Speed of the water current.
- **Downstream Speed:** Speed when the boat moves **with the current**.
- **Upstream Speed:** Speed when the boat moves **against the current**.

---

## **🔹 2. Basic Formulas**
### **1. Downstream Speed**
```math
D = B + S
```

### **2. Upstream Speed**
```math
U = B - S
```

### **3. Speed of Boat in Still Water**
```math
B = \frac{D + U}{2}
```

### **4. Speed of Stream**
```math
S = \frac{D - U}{2}
```

### **5. Time Taken for a Distance (d)**
```math
T = \frac{d}{\text{speed}}
```

---

## **📌 Important Tricks & Shortcuts**

### **🔹 1. If Time Ratio of Upstream to Downstream is Given**
```math
\text{Ratio of Upstream to Downstream Time} = \frac{B + S}{B - S}
```

---

### **🔹 2. If Distance is the Same in Both Directions**
- **Total Time Taken:**
```math
T = \frac{d}{B+S} + \frac{d}{B-S}
```

- **Effective Speed:**
```math
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \times (B+S) \times (B-S)}{(B+S) + (B-S)} = \frac{2BU}{D+U}
```

---

### **🔹 3. If a Boat Covers Distance in T1 Hours Downstream and T2 Hours Upstream**
```math
B = \frac{d \times (T1 + T2)}{2T1T2}
```
```math
S = \frac{d \times (T1 - T2)}{2T1T2}
```

---

### **🔹 4. If Boat Takes T1 Hours Downstream and T2 Hours Upstream for the Same Distance**
```math
B = \frac{(d/T1) + (d/T2)}{2}
```
```math
S = \frac{(d/T1) - (d/T2)}{2}
```

---

### **🔹 5. If a Boat Takes t Minutes More to Travel Upstream than Downstream for Distance d**
```math
S = \frac{d \times t}{2 \times T_d \times T_u}
```

Where:
- **T_d** = Time taken downstream
- **T_u** = Time taken upstream

## **📌 Example Questions with Solutions**

### **📝 Q1: A boat's speed in still water is 10 km/hr, and the stream's speed is 2 km/hr. Find the time taken to travel 40 km downstream.**
**Solution:**  
```math
D = B + S = 10 + 2 = 12 km/hr
```
```math
T = \frac{40}{12} = 3.33 \text{ hours}
```

---

### **📝 Q2: A boat goes 48 km upstream in 8 hours and the same distance downstream in 6 hours. Find B and S.**
**Solution:**  
```math
U = \frac{48}{8} = 6 km/hr
```
```math
D = \frac{48}{6} = 8 km/hr
```
```math
B = \frac{D + U}{2} = \frac{8+6}{2} = 7 km/hr
```
```math
S = \frac{D - U}{2} = \frac{8-6}{2} = 1 km/hr
```

---

### **📝 Q3: A boat's speed in still water is 15 km/hr. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr, how long will it take to go 30 km upstream?**
**Solution:**  
```math
U = B - S = 15 - 3 = 12 km/hr
```
```math
T = \frac{30}{12} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
```

---

### **📝 Q4: A boat takes 4 hours to go 40 km downstream and 5 hours to return upstream. Find B and S.**
**Solution:**  
```math
D = \frac{40}{4} = 10 km/hr
```
```math
U = \frac{40}{5} = 8 km/hr
```
```math
B = \frac{D + U}{2} = \frac{10+8}{2} = 9 km/hr
```
```math
S = \frac{D - U}{2} = \frac{10-8}{2} = 1 km/hr
```

## **🚀 Quick Formula Recap**
| Scenario | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| **Downstream Speed** | \( D = B + S \) |
| **Upstream Speed** | \( U = B - S \) |
| **Speed of Boat in Still Water** | \( B = \frac{D + U}{2} \) |
| **Speed of Stream** | \( S = \frac{D - U}{2} \) |
| **Time Taken for Distance (d)** | \( T = \frac{d}{\text{speed}} \) |
| **Total Time (Same Distance Upstream & Downstream)** | \( T = \frac{d}{B+S} + \frac{d}{B-S} \) |
