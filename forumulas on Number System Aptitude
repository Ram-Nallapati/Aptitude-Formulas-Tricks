## **📌 1. Types of Numbers**
- **Natural Numbers (N)**: {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
- **Whole Numbers (W)**: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Integers (Z)**: {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Rational Numbers (Q)**: Numbers in the form of **p/q**, where q ≠ 0
- **Irrational Numbers**: Non-repeating, non-terminating decimals (e.g., √2, π)
- **Prime Numbers**: Numbers with exactly **two factors: 1 & itself** (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, ...)
- **Composite Numbers**: Numbers with **more than two factors**
- **Even Numbers**: Divisible by 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
- **Odd Numbers**: Not divisible by 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...)

## **📌 2. Divisibility Rules**
| Number | Divisibility Rule |
|--------|------------------|
| **2**  | Last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8) |
| **3**  | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 |
| **4**  | Last two digits form a number divisible by 4 |
| **5**  | Last digit is 0 or 5 |
| **6**  | Divisible by both 2 and 3 |
| **7**  | Double the last digit, subtract from rest; result should be divisible by 7 |
| **8**  | Last three digits form a number divisible by 8 |
| **9**  | Sum of digits is divisible by 9 |
| **10** | Last digit is 0 |
| **11** | Difference between sum of odd and even positioned digits is divisible by 11 |
| **12** | Divisible by both 3 and 4 |

## **📌 3. LCM & HCF Tricks**
- **HCF (Highest Common Factor)**: Largest number that divides all given numbers
- **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: Smallest number divisible by all given numbers

**Formulas:**
```math
HCF × LCM = Product \text{ of numbers}
```
**Shortcut to find HCF & LCM:**
- **HCF**: Find the common factors and take the **largest** one.
- **LCM**: Multiply the highest power of **each prime factor**.

**Example:** Find HCF & LCM of 12 and 18
- **Prime Factorization:**
  - 12 = **2² × 3**
  - 18 = **2 × 3²**
- **HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6**
- **LCM = 2² × 3² = 36**

## **📌 4. Finding Number of Factors**
If a number **N = pⁿ × qᵐ × rᵏ**, then **total factors**:
```math
( n + 1 ) × ( m + 1 ) × ( k + 1 )
```
**Example:** Find factors of **24**
```math
24 = 2³ × 3¹
```
```math
Total Factors = (3+1) × (1+1) = 4 × 2 = 8
```
Factors: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24**

---

## **📌 5. Sum of Factors**
If **N = pⁿ × qᵐ × rᵏ**, then:
```math
Sum = \frac{p^{(n+1)} - 1}{p - 1} \times \frac{q^{(m+1)} - 1}{q - 1} \times \frac{r^{(k+1)} - 1}{r - 1}
```

**Example:** Find sum of factors of **12**
```math
12 = 2² × 3¹
```
```math
Sum = \frac{2³ - 1}{2 - 1} × \frac{3² - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{8 - 1}{1} × \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 7 × 4 = 28
```

---

## **📌 6. Remainder Theorems**
- **Euler's Theorem**: If **a & n** are coprime:
  ```math
a^{φ(n)} \equiv 1 \mod{n}
  ```
  Where **φ(n)** is **Euler's totient function**.
- **Wilson's Theorem**: If **p is prime**, then:
  ```math
(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \mod{p}
  ```
- **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**: If two numbers give remainders **r₁, r₂** when divided by **m₁, m₂**, then CRT helps find the smallest number satisfying both conditions.

## **📌 7. Shortcut Tricks**
### **🔹 Finding Last Digit of a Large Power**
- Identify **last digit** of base
- Use **cyclic pattern**

**Example:** Find last digit of **7¹²³**
- **7’s cycle:** 7 → 9 → 3 → 1
- Divide exponent by **4** (as cycle repeats every 4):
  ```math
123 ÷ 4 = 3 (remainder)
```
- Last digit corresponds to **3rd** term in cycle → **3**

### **🔹 Finding Sum of First N Natural Numbers**
```math
S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
```
### **🔹 Finding Sum of First N Odd Numbers**
```math
S = n²
```
### **🔹 Finding Sum of First N Even Numbers**
```math
S = n(n+1)
```
